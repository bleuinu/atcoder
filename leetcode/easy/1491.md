# 1491. Average Salary Excluding the Min and Max Salary

So many new member functions since C+11!!
I knew about `accumulate` but didn't know about `max_element` nor `min_element`.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double average(vector<int>& salary) {
        double sum = accumulate(salary.begin(), salary.end(), 0);
        auto a = max_element(begin(salary), end(salary));
        auto b = min_element(begin(salary), end(salary));
        sum = sum - *a - *b;
        sum /= (salary.size() - 2);
        return sum;
    }
};
```
