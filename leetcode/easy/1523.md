# 1523. Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range

[problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-odd-numbers-in-an-interval-range/)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countOdds(int low, int high) {
        int cnt = (high - low) >> 1;
        if(low&1 || high&1) ++cnt;
        return cnt;
    }
};
```

At first I used a for loop to simply count all odds, but this gave men TLE.
Then I realized that half of numbers in given range is odd.

I just needed to figure out when to add 1 to the result -- when either start or end is odd.

```cpp
if (low%2 == 1 || high%2 == 1) ++cnt;
```

Faster code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countOdds(int low, int high) {
        int cnt = (high - low) >> 1;
        return cnt + (low&1 || high&1);
    }
};
```
